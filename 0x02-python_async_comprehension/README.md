# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

## Overview

This project delves into the realm of asynchronous programming in Python, specifically focusing on asynchronous comprehensions and generators. It explores key concepts such as asynchronous programming, async generators, async comprehensions, and the asyncio module.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Write asynchronous generators and comprehend their usage.
- Utilize async comprehensions to perform asynchronous operations and collect results.
- Understand the asyncio module and its features for managing asynchronous tasks.
- Explore concurrency and how it enables efficient execution of multiple tasks simultaneously.

## Resources

- [PEP 530 – Asynchronous Comprehensions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0530/)
- [What’s New in Python: Asynchronous Comprehensions / Generators](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#pep-530-asynchronous-comprehensions)
- [Type-hints for generators](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generator)

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7
- Files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the folder is mandatory
- Code should adhere to PEP8 style guidelines
- Functions and coroutines must be type-annotated
- Modules and functions should have proper documentation

## Tasks

1. **Async Generator**: Write a coroutine to asynchronously generate random numbers.
2. **Async Comprehensions**: Use async comprehensions to collect random numbers asynchronously.
3. **Run time for four parallel comprehensions**: Measure the total runtime for executing async comprehensions in parallel.

## Usage

To run the tasks, execute the respective main files:

```bash
./0-main.py
./1-main.py
./2-main.py
```
