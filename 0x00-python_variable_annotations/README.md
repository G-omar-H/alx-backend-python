# Python Variable Annotations Project

Welcome to the Python Variable Annotations Project! Get ready to dive into the fascinating world of Python variable annotations and master the art of type hints.

## Overview

In this project, you'll explore the power of type annotations in Python 3. You'll learn how to:

- Utilize type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types.
- Embrace the concept of duck typing.
- Validate your code using the powerful tool, mypy.

## Tasks

Here's a sneak peek of what you'll be working on:

1. **Basic Annotations:** Dive into the basics with functions and type annotations.
2. **Complex Types:** Tackle lists and mixed data types with confidence using type annotations.
3. **Duck Typing:** Embrace the flexibility of Python with annotations for dynamic parameters.
4. **Type Checking:** Validate your code using mypy and ensure your type annotations are on point.
